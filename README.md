19/12/2019

This is my SOFTWARE ENGINEERING ARCHITECTURES & DESIGN PATTERNS Course Project, it is a restaurant management system where you can order from several restaurants and have your food
delivered to you. As an admin, you have the ability to manage restaurants and items, as well as manage users and promocodes.
As a restaurant manager, you have the ability to manage your restaurants and items. As a delivery man, you have the ability to view and
update the status of delivered orders. As a customer, you have the ability to pick food you like, add it to your cart, apply a promocode and checkout.
All users have the ability to view their orders and manage their own accounts.
